## Checking Standard Recovery and Curves


Here are plots of the % recovery (extrapolated concentration/ known concentration x 100) for the standards that were either within or above the detection range, with lines at the "good recovery" limits of 80 and 120% recovery.

The R^2^ values for goodness-of-fit for the standard curves were all >0.99

```{r standards,echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}


stnds_dat7Dec16<-filter(dat7Dec16, Sample.Group == "Standards")



#which standards are out of det. range?
standardsOutOfRange<-stnds_dat7Dec16 %>%
  filter(Detection.Range != "In Detection Range")%>%
  select(Plate.Name,Sample, Assay, Detection.Range, X..Recovery, Calc..Concentration)



#looking at which samples have STDs below the fit curve or below the detection range (i.e. you can't get numbers for % recovery) 

stnds_below_dat7Dec16<- stnds_dat7Dec16%>%
  filter(Detection.Range == "Below Fit Curve Range" | Detection.Range == "Below Detection Range") %>%
  group_by(Sample)%>%
  summarise("Number of Samples Below Fit Curve Range/Detection Range" = n())


whichAssay_stnds_below_dat7Dec16<-stnds_dat7Dec16 %>%
   filter(Detection.Range == "Below Fit Curve Range" | Detection.Range == "Below Detection Range") %>%
  filter(!str_detect(Sample, "008"))%>%
  select(Sample, Assay, Detection.Range)
```


```{r percent recovery, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 12,echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#The samples that actually give me #'s for percent recovery ( i.e. all but the "below fit curve range" and "below detection range" ones)

stnds_percent_recov_dat7Dec16<- stnds_dat7Dec16 %>% 
  arrange(Sample,Assay)%>%
  filter(Detection.Range != "Below Fit Curve Range" & Detection.Range!= "Below Detection Range")%>%

#checking the R squared goodness-of-fit for the standard curves

```

## Caveats about Standards

* Standards with values *below the detection range* (<2.5x the standard deviation of the lowest standard) give unreliable concentrations, so I did not include those in the plots.

* When standards are *below the curve fit* (outside the range of the standard curve), the software does not calculate concentrations so you can't get a percent recovery.

* Most of the Standards that fell into either of these categories were from the least concentrated standard (diluent only) except for two from Standard 6 and five from standard 7:

`r pander(stnds_below_dat7Dec16)`

`r pander(whichAssay_stnds_below_dat7Dec16)`

```{r Josh samples and controls,echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

#make a column for Dilution and a column for sample type

CVLpool<-dat7Dec16 %>%
filter(str_detect(Sample, "P|pool"))%>%
mutate(Dilution = ifelse(
str_detect(Sample, "1:10"), "1:10", "neat"))%>%
mutate(Type = ifelse(
str_detect(Sample, "Cocktail"), "Test","Control"))
```


## Testing effects of transport media cocktail

We added the following reagents to our usual control CVL pool to mimic the transport medium:

* Protease Inhibitor at a 1x final concentration (Calbiochem, lot 2746008, catalog #: 539131-1VL)

* 10% Igepal (Sigma, lot 51K0084, catalog #: 1-3021)

* 0.25% BSA (Sigma, lot 018K699, cat # A9647-500G)

We tested both a "neat" and 1:10 dilution of the samples. All samples were run in duplicate.

```{r below detection,echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

CVLpoolDetect<-CVLpool %>%
filter(!Detection.Range == "In Detection Range")%>%
select(Assay, Dilution,Type, Detection.Range)%>%
group_by(Assay,Type,Dilution, Detection.Range)%>%
summarise("Number In Range" = n())

names(CVLpoolDetect)[4]<- "Detection Range"

```
  
#Results

For some cytokines, some of the sample concentrations fell below the detection range:

`r pander(CVLpoolDetect)`


There was a wide range of concentrations across cytokines but the test and control samples were similar:

```{r all concentrations,echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}


inRangeCVLpool<-CVLpool %>%
filter(Detection.Range == "In Detection Range")


ggplot(inRangeCVLpool, aes(x = Dilution, y = Calc..Concentration))+
geom_point(aes(color = Type))+
labs(y = "Cytokine Concentration (pg/ml)")+
facet_wrap(~Assay, scales = "free_y")+
ggtitle("Cytokine Concentrations (note scales)")

```
